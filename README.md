# CADViewer REST API Conversion Server
 Sample for testing the CADViewer Conversion Server REST API
  
The TailorMade CADViewer RESTFUL API is a server side infrastructure component that allows you send AutoCAD DWG, DXF and DWF files, MicroStation DGN, Adobe PDF, and other high resolution floorplans in vector formats into a server for processing.

The CADViewer restful server responds with a number of various formats, JSON and CSV for data extraction, SVG and PDF for data conversion, and also a http link instance of CADViewer standard interface can be returned for encapsulation into an application.
